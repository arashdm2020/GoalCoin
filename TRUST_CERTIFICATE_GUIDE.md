# How to Fix "Not Secure" Warning for Localhost (HTTPS)

This guide explains how to make your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) trust the local SSL certificates generated by `mkcert`. This will remove the "Not Secure" warning and show a green lock icon.

## The Problem

Your servers are correctly using SSL certificates, but your browser doesn't trust the *issuer* of those certificates. The issuer is a local "Certificate Authority" (CA) created by `mkcert` on your machine. You just need to tell your system and browser to trust this local CA.

## The Solution: Install the Local CA

This is a one-time setup. Once you do this, all local projects using `mkcert` will be trusted automatically.

### Step 1: Open a Terminal as Administrator

1.  Click the **Start Menu**.
2.  Type `PowerShell`.
3.  Right-click on **"Windows PowerShell"** and select **"Run as administrator"**. 

### Step 2: Run the `mkcert -install` Command

In the administrator terminal you just opened, copy and paste the following command and press Enter:

```powershell
# Path to the mkcert executable in your Downloads folder
C:\Users\abdi1\Downloads\mkcert-v1.4.4-windows-amd64.exe -install
```

### Step 3: Verify the Output

You should see a success message. It will look like one of these:

- `The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! 👍`
- `The local CA is already installed in the system trust store! 👍` (if you've run it before)

If you see an error, ensure you are running the terminal as an administrator.

### Step 4: Completely Restart Your Browser

This is the most important step!

1.  Close **ALL** open windows of your browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.).
2.  To be sure, you can open Task Manager (`Ctrl+Shift+Esc`) and end any remaining browser processes.
3.  Re-open your browser.

### Step 5: Test

- Run the project using `quick-start-https.bat`.
- Navigate to `https://localhost:3000` and `https://localhost:3001`.

**The "Not Secure" warning should be gone, replaced by a lock icon.**

## Final Solution for Chrome (99% Success Rate)

If you have tried everything and Chrome still shows "Not Secure", this advanced solution will force Chrome to use the Windows certificate store, just like Edge does.

### Step 1: Open Chrome Flags

In the Chrome address bar, type `chrome://flags` and press Enter.

### Step 2: Find and Disable the Chrome Root Store

1.  In the search box, type: `Chrome Root Store`
2.  Find the flag named **"Chrome Root Store"**.
3.  Change its setting from "Default" or "Enabled" to **"Disabled"**.

### Step 3: Relaunch Chrome

Click the **"Relaunch"** button that appears at the bottom.

After restarting, the "Not Secure" warning should be gone. If it still persists, proceed with the troubleshooting steps below.

## Ultimate Solution: Create a New Chrome Profile

If all else fails, the issue is almost certainly with a corrupted Chrome user profile. Creating a new, clean profile will resolve this.

### Step 1: Open Profile Settings

1.  In Chrome, click your profile picture in the top-right corner.

### Step 2: Add a New Profile

1.  Click the **"Add"** button at the bottom of the menu.
2.  Click **"Continue without an account"**.
3.  Give the new profile a name (e.g., "Development") and click **"Done"**.

### Step 3: Test in the New Profile

A new Chrome window will open with the fresh profile. In this new window, navigate to `https://localhost:3000`.

The site should now load with a secure lock icon. This confirms the issue was with your old profile's cache or settings.

## Troubleshooting

If the problem persists, try these steps.

### Alternative: Manually Import the CA into Chrome

1.  In Chrome, go to `chrome://settings/security`.
2.  Scroll down and click **"Manage certificates"**.
3.  Go to the **"Trusted Root Certification Authorities"** tab.
4.  Click **"Import..."**.
5.  Click **"Next"**, then **"Browse..."**.
6.  In the file path, paste this and press Enter:
    ```
    C:\Users\abdi1\AppData\Local\mkcert
    ```
7.  Select the `rootCA.pem` file and click **"Open"**.
8.  Click **"Next"** through the rest of the prompts, using the default settings. Click **"Finish"**.
9.  **Restart your browser completely.**

### Clear Browser Cache

Sometimes the old, untrusted certificate is cached.

1.  In Chrome, press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`.
2.  Set the time range to **"All time"**.
3.  Check the box for **"Cached images and files"**.
4.  Click **"Clear data"**.
5.  **Restart your browser completely.**
